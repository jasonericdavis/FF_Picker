# Fanatasy Football Picker
Whether its daily lineups or season-long leagues, I like to play fantasy football. Almost all fantasy football webapps have their own tools that provide suggestions on which players to choose or play. I never know how they derive at these numbers and blindly trust the values. What if I could come up with my own system for deciding which players to pick? This project is a tool to help me decide what players to pick when choosing my fantasy football lineups for the day using my own calculations. I am by no means a Math scholoar so my calculations will be quite trivial. Anyone is free to use this tool and offers suggestions. This will probably take some time to build, so my goal is build something that can be used and iterated on throughout the 2021-2021 season.
